That's a graph library I use in pure clojure.


There is not automatic documentation available for now but source code is documented.

At the center there is the GraphProtocol which defines some set of operations you
want to do on a Graph.

Then there is three implementation of that protocol :
- linked-graph : fast access to nodes and links
- adjency-graph : fast access to adjency relation
- func-graph : for graphs defined in term of a predicate over the link of a
  complete graph.
